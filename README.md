## Project: On the Heat equations(parabolic PDEs), maximum principle and weak solution with their regularities
### Abstract
We study the heat equation as second order parabolic partial differential
equation. We use Fourier transform technique(one of the many techniques)
to derive the general solution of the heat equation. We estimate these solu-
tions of heat equations in L∞ using Maximum Principle. We prove maximum
principle using Divergence theorem. We show the uniqueness. We give a state-
ment about smoothness. We calculate the priori energy estimates in L∞ by
using integration by parts. Then, We generalize the heat equation as general
second order partial differential equations. We construct the weak formula-
tions of such second order partial differential equations using test function
from infinitely differentiable space and derive priori estimate of weak solution.
Before, we show the existence and uniqueness of classical solution using maxi-
mum principle, here we use priori energy estimate and Galerkin approximation
technique (other technique can be Lax Milgram Methods)to show the existence
and uniqueness of the weak solutions. To prove existence, we try to construct
Galerkin approximation to certain extend followed by citations of literature
for explicit proof. Then, we prove uniqueness and moved to regularity. Using
energy estimate and other inequalities (mainly related to Sobolev space), we
talk about regularities. We see theorems(without proof) on how lower order
derivatives can estimate higher order derivative. We say, with further con-
struction, using regularities and Sobolev embedding theorem, we can see weak
solutions are infact smooth, classical solution solutions. We say this regularity
estimation mirros with similiar estimate for elliptical case.(stated in the Evans
book of Partial Differential Equations [1]) For further study, we can reflect,
we can derive analytical estimate from structural algebraic assumption.
The main project question is to derive maximum principle using divergence
theorem for which I have done some calculations in chapter 3 (supported by
Appendix part). Another, question is "Does the u from priori estimate suffice
maximum principle? Is u regular?" This thesis is written trying to answer
these questions.
